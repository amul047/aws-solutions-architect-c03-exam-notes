# AWS Solutions Architect Associate

## Context
- [I am a software architect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aamirmulla/) having worked primarily in the application development space, not networking. 
- I have done so on premise, in Heroku and Azure. 
- I have also worked on PoCs (proof of concepts) across GCP and AWS.
- I also sat the AWS developer associate exam in 2019, but never used it in production since.
- With my workplace now gravitating towards AWS more recently, I want to prepare myself and tick off AWS solutions architect associate exam as well.
- Exam is scheduled for next week, and these will be my last shrinking set of notes before I sit it.

## Acknowledgements
- I have used https://learn.cantrill.io/ as my primary resource for learning, based on recommendation of my ex-colleague and friend [Shawn Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnjiang/). I would reccomend it highly too now, as Adrian (the author) not only covers the exam, but uses nice diagrams and concise explanations in shorter than 20 minute lessons.

## Let's do it!
